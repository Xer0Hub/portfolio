Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio of projects. 
I give my thanks and credit to 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu for teaching me strong fundamentals, 
and beginning my journey in coding.
Some of these projects were assisted by her bootcamp, whilst others I made up out of inspiration from what I was learning. 
Your feedback is always welcome and appreciated.
